Cylc xtrigger script. Monitor the filesystem for the presence of a completed raw
file corresponding to the current workflow cycle point.
Xtriggers are referenced in the flow.cylc file, and called asynchronously in the
process pool. They must be defined in a module with the same name as the xtrigger
function. For more informations, see:
https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/8.2.4/html/user-guide/writing-workflows/external-triggers.html#custom-trigger-functions

# But if you use print() and set the --debug flag when launching `cylc play`,
# Cylc will show the print() output in the scheduler log. That's why we use
# `print("Debug: ðŸŸ  ...)` here.
