Here are discussed some of the choices made during the development of the project (coding styles for
different languages, pattern used in Cylc, etc).

You'll also find some guidelines on how to add a new task or configuration option to the workflow.

.. note:: 
    It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of:
        * Cylc,
        * Python, R and Bash.

    For further information on Cylc, please consult their :ref:`cylc:user guide`.
