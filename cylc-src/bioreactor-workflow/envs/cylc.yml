# cylc requires `bash`, GNU `coreutils` and `mail` (optional) which are not installed by conda.

# MAKE THE WRAPPER SCRIPT
# cylc get-resources cylc /path/to/cylc  # should be in $PATH
# chmod +x /path/to/cylc

# MAYBE TRUE, TO INVESTIGATE:
# conda config --set auto_activate_base false
# Needed for cylc subprocesses to not get the "cylc: command not found" error.
